# This project uses Terraform Cloud.
# Each TF Cloud Workspace maps to
# one project environment.

# Setup a separate TF Cloud Workspace
# per environment
# to track changes to related TF files
# with mapping to a environment folder
# by adding TF Working Directory

# Create 1 or N separate AWS IAM users
# with programmatic access
# to use AWS_ACCESS_KEY and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_ID credentials
# in TF Cloud Workspaces as environment variables.
